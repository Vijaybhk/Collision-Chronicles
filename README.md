Comprehensive Analysis on US Accident Data(2016-2021).

In 2022, there will be close to 300 million vehicles in operation in the United States, according to a research article published by Mathilde Carlier in Statista. According to the Annual United States Road Crash Statistics (ASIRT), more than 46,000 individuals die in car accidents yearly.

With the increase in the number of vehicles operating on the road, there is a rise in the number of accidents and fatalities across the country every day. So, the need for Accident Analysis has increased tremendously as reducing road accidents is a vital public safety concern on a worldwide scale. Road accidents have become a concern for both the government and individuals as these accidents are typically fatal and pose a risk to society.

There are multiple challenges with the methods by which the government is trying to prevent accidents. Hence, a robust analysis of road accidents enables us to identify and categorize the causes of road car accidents. The analysis and identification of the accident causes would help prevent similar accidents from happening again and paves a road map for future projects. This report aims to address this problem and examine the primary causes of the rise in car accidents.
